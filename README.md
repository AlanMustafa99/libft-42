# 📚 Libft – 42 Wolfsburg

Welcome! This repository contains my implementation of **Libft**, one of the first core projects at [42 Wolfsburg](https://42wolfsburg.de/). The goal was to rebuild key functions from the C standard library entirely from scratch — no shortcuts, no `<string.h>`!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project covers:

- ✅ Reimplementation of standard C functions:
  - `ft_strlen`, `ft_strdup`, `ft_memset`, `ft_atoi`, `ft_isalpha`, ...
- 🔁 Memory and string handling
- 🧩 Bonus: Linked list utilities:
  - `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstclear`, `ft_lstmap`, etc.

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Manual memory management with `malloc` and `free`
- Writing safe and reusable C functions
- Modular project structure and Makefile usage
- Deep understanding of pointer logic in C

## 🔧 Compilation

To build the library and generate `libft.a`:

```bash
make
